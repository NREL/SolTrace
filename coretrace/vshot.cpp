Given a location defined by xray and yray, interpolates to find the best guess for the corresponding measured slope.
This  version assumes a dual curvature or axisymmetric optical element.  Weighting is a function of the actual radial distance from the ray
intersection point to VSHOT data points within a radius defined by the density of points and a chosen limited number of nearest neighbors.
